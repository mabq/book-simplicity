# Distinguishing actions, calculations and data

> 🚀 &nbsp; Always prefer data over calculations and calculations over actions

Functional programming is all about **organizing side-effects** so that they don’t just occur anywhere.

Actions, calculations, and data are the first and most important distinction functional programmers make:

- Actions depend on time, so they are the hardest to get right, we separate them so we can devote more focus to them.
- Calculations do not depend on time, so we want to write more code in this category because they are so easy to get right.
- Data is inert and require interpretation. Data is easy to understand, store, and transmit.

Time dependable code is much harder to test, reuse and maintain, so the goal is to move code from actions to calculations and data.


<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------- -->


## Data

### What is data? 

Data is facts about events. It is a record of something that happened. Functional programmers tap into the rich tradition of record-keeping that started thousands of years ago.

Immutable data flows from one calculation to the next — inputs and outputs, no hidden magic.

### How do we implement data?

Using built-in data types — the JavaScript set of types consists of:

- *Primitive values* — immutable values represented directly at the lowest level of the language.
  - Boolean type
  - Null type
  - Undefined type
  - Number type
  - BigInt type
  - String type
  - Symbol type

- *Objects* — collections of properties (key-value pairs).

### How does data encode meaning?

Data encodes meaning in structure. The structure of the data should mirror the structure of the problem domain you are implementing. For instance, if the order of a list of names is important, you should choose a data structure that maintains order.

Choosing the right data structure is critical for a straight forward implementation.

### Why is immutable data so important?

> 🤓 &nbsp; It is impossible to write calculations on mutable data — mutable data means time dependability

Let's see why:

- What happens when you pass a primitive value to a function? — operations inside will create new values (not mutate them), since those values are not accessible from outer scope no side-effects are created
- What happens when you pass an object to a function? — operations inside will effectively mutate the object, since that object is accessible from outer scope side-effects are created

Both, variables declared in outer scopes and variables declared in local scope point to the same addresses in memory, for more information read [how data, variables and scopes work](extras/data_variables_scopes.md).

### How do we implement immutability in JavaScript?

> 🚀 &nbsp; Always use Immer to apply changes to objects

Never mutate data — *copy-on-write* is a discipline for ensuring immutability within code that we control. It requires *shallow-copies*.

Never let untrusted code access your data — *defensive copying* is a discipline for ensuring immutability with code that we don't control. It is expensive since it requires making *deep-copies* every time data leaves or enters our code.

Use a library — [Immer](https://github.com/immerjs/immer) is a tiny library that simplifies handling immutable data structures, its key benefits are:

1. Boilerplate reduction — less noise, more concise code
2. No new APIs or data structures
3. Structural sharing out of the box — better performance
4. Object freezing out of the box — more secure
5. Easy deep updates
6. No accidental mutations

While *defensive-copying* works by protecting the memory addresses of our objects (mutable data), Immer works by making those objects immutable, so that they can be shared securely between shallow-copies or with untrusted code.

### Why data over calculations?

- Data is *serializable* — no problem being transmitted over a wire or stored to disk and read back later.
- Data is *comparable* — easily compare two pieces of data to see if they are equal or not.
- Data is *open for interpretation*.

## Calculations

### What are calculations?

Calculations are computations from inputs to outputs.

> 🚀 &nbsp; No matter when they are run, or how many times they are run, they will give the same output for the same inputs

### How do we implement calculations?

We represent calculations as functions that depend on nothing else but its arguments and whose only effect is its return value.

Calculations are *referentially transparent* because a call to a calculation can be replaced by its result. For instance, `+` is a calculation. `2 + 3` always results in `5`, so you could replace the code `2 + 3` with `5` and have an equivalent program. That means you can call `2 + 3` zero, one, or more times and get the same result.

### Why prefer calculations over actions?

> 🚀 &nbsp; Removing time dependability makes code so much easier to understand

You can read the code and know what it is going to do. There’s a whole list of things you don’t have to worry about:

- What else is running at the same time
- What has run in the past and what will run in the future
- How many times you have already run it

They’re much easier to test. You can run them as many times as you want or wherever you want (local machine, build server, testing machine) in order to test them.

They’re very composable. Calculations can be put together into bigger calculations in very flexible ways. They can also be used in what are called “higher-order” calculations.

They’re much easier to maintain. Calculations are much more reliable, you can change everything but the function signature with affecting any other code.

They're ready for distributed systems. The next paradigm is Distributed Eventual Programming.

## Actions

Actions are functions with implicit inputs or implicit outputs.

Depending on anything or affecting anything outside of function scope means *time dependability* — the result could be different depending on *when* we call the function (any time range is valid) or *how many times* we call the function.

> 🚀 &nbsp; Time dependability is a big deal, it makes code much harder to reuse, test and maintain.

Because actions are the hardest to get right, we separate them so we can devote more focus to them.

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------- -->
Actions spread — one little action somewhere and it spreads all over.

Don't allow any code to mutate data values accessible from your code.


<mark>***Shared mutable state is time dependent***</mark> 

***Keep actions small***, remove everything that isn’t necessary from the action. Restrict actions to interactions with the world.

Minimize implicit inputs and outputs — any that you can eliminate will improve the testability and reusability of your actions, even if you don’t cross into calculation land. Select and extract the calculation code, convert implicit inputs to arguments, and implicit outputs to return values.

Limit time dependency whenever possible — e.g. allow an action to run once.

Actions often depend on smaller actions, calculations, and data. Decompose an action into smaller actions repeatedly until no more actions are needed, then compose them back.
