# First-class functions

### What does first-class mean?

First-class values are anything that can be:

1. Assign to a variable
2. Pass as an argument to a function
3. Returned from a function
4. Stored in an array or object

In JavaScript functions are first-class values. Many other parts are not (arithmetic operators, for loops, if statements, try/catch blocks, etc), but we can wrap those parts with functions to make them first-class.

### What are higher order functions?

Functions that take other functions as arguments, or that return a function, are called "higher order functions".

Higher order functions allow us better express the intent of the code and potentially eliminate duplication. Let's see how.

#### *Code smell: Implicit argument in function name*

The characteristics of this code smell are:

1. Very similar implementations
2. The name of function indicates the difference in implementation

The function name difference is an implicit argument — whenever we have an implicit argument as part of the name of the function we can apply the following refactoring.

#### *Refactoring: Express implicit argument*

The basic idea is to turn the implicit argument (in the name) into an explicit argument. Here are the steps:

1. Identify the implicit argument in the name of the function
2. Add explicit argument
3. Use new argument in body in place of hard-coded value
4. Update the calling code

For example:

```javascript
// Replace any number of functions like this...
function setPriceByName(cart, name, price) {}
function setQuantityByName(cart, name, quantity) {}
function setShippingByName(cart, name, shipping) {}

// With a generic function like this...
function setFieldByName(cart, name, field, value) {
    // pass 'price', 'quantity' or any other string as an argument to 'field'
}
```

*Will field names as strings lead to more bugs?* — the fact that we can actually pass any string value to `field` makes us loose control over the object we are operating on. We have two options:

1. Compile-time checks — TypeScript would allow us to check that the strings belong to a known set of valid fields, runs once on compile time.
2. Run-time checks — check that the strings we pass in are valid, every time we run the function.

```javascript
var validItemFields = ['price', 'quantity', 'shipping', 'tax'];

function setFieldByName(cart, name, field, value) { 
    if(!validItemFields.includes(field)) {
        throw "Not a valid item field: " + "'" + field + "'.";
    }
    //...
}
```

*Will first-class fields make the API hard to change?* — let’s say we needed to change `quantity` to `number` for some reason. We don’t want to break all of the existing code, so we still have to accept `quantity`. We can just swap it out ourselves:

```javascript
var validItemFields = ['price', 'quantity', 'shipping', 'tax', 'number'];
var translations = { 'quantity': 'number' };

function setFieldByName(cart, name, field, value) { 
    if(!validItemFields.includes(field)) {
        throw "Not a valid item field: " + "'" + field + "'.";
    }
    if(translations.hasOwnProperty(field)) {
        field = translations[field];
    }
    //...
}
```

The field names we are exposing now as strings were all being exposed in the function names. But now we have the flexibility to change field names with a minor update.



#### Refactoring: Replace body with callback

This refactoring allows you to replace the body (the part that changes) of a piece of code with a callback. You can then pass in the behavior in a first-class function. It is a powerful way to create higher-order functions from existing code.

Steps:

1. Identify the before, body, and after sections
2. Extract the whole thing into a function
3. Extract the body section into a function passed as an argument to that function
