# First-class functions

## What does first-class mean?

First-class values can be:

1. Assigned to variables
2. Passed as arguments to functions
3. Returned from functions
4. Stored in arrays or objects

In JavaScript ***functions are first-class values***. Many other parts are not (arithmetic operators, for loops, if statements, try/catch blocks, etc), but we can wrap those parts with functions to make them first-class.

## Abstracting logic with data

### Code smell: Implicit argument in function name

This code smell identifies aspects of code that could be better expressed as first-class values. If you are referring to a value in the body of a function, and that value is named in the function name, this smell applies. Hear are the characteristics:

1. There are very similar function implementations
2. The name of the function indicates the difference in implementation

### Refactoring: Express implicit argument

When you have an implicit argument in the function name, how do you turn that into an actual argument to the function? This refactoring adds an argument to your function so that the value becomes first-class. This may let you better express the intent of the code and potentially eliminate duplication. Here are the steps:

1. Identify the implicit argument in the name of the function
2. Add explicit argument
3. Use new argument in body in place of hard-coded value
4. Update the calling code

For example:

```javascript
// We can replace any number of functions like this...
function setPriceByName(cart, name, price) {}
function setQuantityByName(cart, name, quantity) {}
function setShippingByName(cart, name, shipping) {}

// With a generic function like this...
function setFieldByName(cart, name, field, value) {
    // pass 'price', 'quantity' or any other string as an argument to 'field'
}
```

### Will field names as strings lead to more bugs?

The fact that we can actually pass any string value to `field` makes us lose control over the object we are operating on. We have two options:

1. Compile-time checks â€” TypeScript would allow us to check that the strings belong to a known set of valid fields, runs once on compile time.
2. Run-time checks â€” check that the strings we pass in are valid, every time we run the function.

```javascript
var validItemFields = ['price', 'quantity', 'shipping', 'tax'];

function setFieldByName(cart, name, field, value) { 
    if(!validItemFields.includes(field)) {
        throw "Not a valid item field: " + "'" + field + "'.";
    }
    //...
}
```

### It's all strings on the wire!

The problem of strings goes much deeper than we often like to think. Our web browsers send JSON to the server. That JSON is just strings. The server will receive and parse it. The server hopes the message is well-formed JSON. If it is well formed, then we hope that the data structure is understandable.

The same goes for the web server talking to the database. The web server has to serialize the commands to the database into a string that gets serialized over the wire. The database has to parse and interpret it. Itâ€™s all strings on that wire, too. And even if there are types built into the data format, itâ€™s still just bytes â€” plenty of opportunity for typos or malicious behavior.

> ðŸš€ &nbsp; An API must check data at runtime as it enters the server from a client, even if itâ€™s a static language. All the static type system can do is guarantee that the code in one piece of the system is consistent with the assumptions you encode as types.

Does that mean you shouldnâ€™t use static types? No. Does it mean you should? No. 

> You should just be aware that dynamic typing did not create this problem and static typing doesnâ€™t make it go away.

> Weâ€™re seeing one downside of data: It requires interpretation.

### Will first-class fields make the API hard to change?

Letâ€™s say we needed to change `quantity` to `number` for some reason. We donâ€™t want to break all of the existing code, so we still have to accept `quantity`. We can just swap it out ourselves:

```javascript
var validItemFields = ['price', 'quantity', 'shipping', 'tax', 'number'];
var translations = { 'quantity': 'number' };

function setFieldByName(cart, name, field, value) { 
    if(!validItemFields.includes(field)) {
        throw "Not a valid item field: " + "'" + field + "'.";
    }
    if(translations.hasOwnProperty(field)) {
        field = translations[field];
    }
    //...
}
```

The field names we are exposing now as strings were all being exposed in the function names. But now we have the flexibility to change field names with a minor update.


## Abstracting logic with functions

Functions that take other functions as arguments, or that return a function, are called "higher order functions" â€” they can remove a lot of duplication, but sometimes they cost readability. Learn them well and use them wisely.

> ðŸš€ &nbsp; Higher-order functions let us set up contexts for code defined elsewhere. The context becomes reusable because itâ€™s in a function.

### Refactoring: Replace body with callback

The syntax of a language is often not first-class. This refactoring allows you to replace the body (the part that changes) of a piece of code with a callback. You can then pass in the behavior in a first-class function. It is a powerful way to create higher-order functions from existing code. Here are the steps:

1. Identify the before, body, and after sections
2. Extract the whole thing into a function
3. Extract the body section into a function passed as an argument to that function

#### Example 1

```js
/* ---------------------------------------------------------------- */
// Before refactoring
/* ---------------------------------------------------------------- */

// many blocks like this one...
try {
    saveUserData(user); // <- where only this part changes
} catch (error) {
    logToSnapErrors(error);
}

/* ---------------------------------------------------------------- */
// After refactoring
/* ---------------------------------------------------------------- */

// this function can add the logging functionality to any other function
function withLogging(f) {
    // returning functions from functions lets us make function factories
    return function (...args) {
        try {
            f(...args);
        } catch (error) {
            logToSnapErrors(error);
        }
    }
}

function saveUserData(user) { /*...*/ }

const saveUserDataWithLogging = withLogging(saveUserData);
```

The reason we are passing in a function is so that the code in that function can be run in a particular context (try/catch block). Higher-order functions let you differ by code to execute (the callback) instead of just data.

#### Example 2

```js
/* ---------------------------------------------------------------- */
// Before refactoring
/* ---------------------------------------------------------------- */

// Many functions with similar implementations...
function arraySet(array, idx, value) {
    var copy = array.slice(); // <- same on all functions
    copy[idx] = value; // <- differentiation
    return copy; // <- same on all functions
}

function push(array, elem) {
    var copy = array.slice();
    copy.push(elem);
    return copy;
}

function drop_last(array) {
    var array_copy = array.slice();
    array_copy.pop();
    return array_copy;
}

function drop_first(array) {
    var array_copy = array.slice();
    array_copy.shift();
    return array_copy;
}

/* ---------------------------------------------------------------- */
// After refactoring
/* ---------------------------------------------------------------- */

// One reusable function that standardizes the copy-on-write discipline...
function withArrayCopy(array, modify) {
    var copy = array.slice();
    modify(copy);
    return copy;
}

// All implementations are now based on 'withArrayCopy'...
function arraySet(array, idx, value) {
    return withArrayCopy(array, (copy) => (copy[idx] = value));
}

function push(array, value) {
    return withArrayCopy(array, (copy) => copy.push(value));
}

function drop_last(array) {
    return withArrayCopy(array, (copy) => copy.pop());
}

function drop_first(array) {
    return withArrayCopy(array, (copy) => copy.shift());
}
```

#### What benefits did we achieve?

1. *Standardized discipline* â€” we have codified and standardized the copy-on-write discipline for arrays. It no longer has to be written the same way all over the codebase. Itâ€™s in one place.
2. *Applied discipline to new operations* â€” `withArrayCopy()` can handle any operation that modifies an array.
3. *Optimized sequences of modifications* â€” a series of copy-on-write operations will create a new copy for each operation, `withArrayCopy()` gives us a way to optimize them by making a single copy.

```js
/* ---------------------------------------------------------------- */
// Before refactoring
/* ---------------------------------------------------------------- */

// This code makes four copies of the array...
const a1 = drop_first(array);
const a2 = push(a1, 10);
const a3 = push(a2, 11);
const a4 = arraySet(a3, 0, 42);

/* ---------------------------------------------------------------- */
// After refactoring
/* ---------------------------------------------------------------- */

// This code makes a single copy of the array...
const a4 = withArrayCopy(array, (copy) => {
    // make four modifications to the copy...
    copy.shift();
    copy.push(10);
    copy.push(11);
    copy[0] = 42;
});
```
