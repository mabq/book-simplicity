# Vocabulary

### Side effects

Are any behavior of a function besides the return value.

Side effects are necessary yet problematic, functional programming has lots of tools for working with them.

### Pure functions

Functions that depend only on their arguments and don’t have any side effects.

### Referentially transparent

Means that a call to a calculation can be replaced by its result without affecting the program.

### DOM

The document object model (DOM) is the in-memory representation of an HTML page in a browser.

### Refactoring

Restructuring code without changing the programs behavior.

### Copy-on-write

Copying a mutable value before you modify it is a way to implement immutability.

### Nested data

Data structures inside data structures; we can talk about the inner data structure and the top-level data structure.

### Deep copy

Duplicate all levels of nested data structures, from the top all the way to the bottom.

### Shallow copy

Copying only the top-level data structure in nested data.

### Structural sharing

Two nested data structures referencing the same inner data structure.

### Legacy code

Code (perhaps written with older practices) that we can’t replace at the moment. We have to work with it as is.

### Software design

Using one’s aesthetic sense to guide programming choices to improve the ease of coding, testing, and maintaining software.

### Stratified design

A design technique that builds software in layers.

### Code Smell

A characteristic of a piece of code that might be a symptom of deeper problems.

### Data orientation

Is a style of programming that uses generic data structures to represent facts about events and entities.

### Higher-order

Functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as their return values.

### Anonymous function

Is a function without a name. That usually happens when we define the function inline.

### Inline function

Is a function defined where it is used. For example, a function might be defined in the argument list.

### Predicates 

Functions that return `true` or `false`. 

### The identity function 

Is a function that returns its argument unchanged. It appears to do nothing, but it is useful for indicating just that: Nothing should be done.
